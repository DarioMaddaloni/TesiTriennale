Bachelor thesis about continuous fractions and Pellâ€™s equation

I'm sorry for non-italian speaker, but this was a bachelor thesis and so it was drawn up in italian.
Anyway, if you are interested in, feel free to contact me.

Tesi_Laurea_Triennale.pdf is the thesis (about 30 pages). It is complete of definitions, lemmas,
propositions, theorems and their corresponding proofs.

Tesi_Laurea_Triennale_Slides.pdf is only a brief presentation of the real thesis.
It has been thought to be used as an instrument to have a quick idea of the themes.
